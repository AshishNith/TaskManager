# Task Manager Web App

This is a simple Task Manager web application built using Python and Flask. The app allows users to add tasks, delete tasks, and set deadlines for each task. The goal of this project is to provide a basic yet functional task management tool while offering a learning experience in web development using Flask.

## Features

- **Add New Task**: Users can add a task with a title and a deadline.
- **Delete Task**: Users can delete a task from the list.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and works well on different screen sizes.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for backend development.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework used to build the web application.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database used to store the tasks.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the frontend design and layout of the web pages.
